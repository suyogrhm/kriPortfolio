            <h1>Journey at GreedyGame</h1>
            <p>During my tenure at GreedyGame, I had the privilege to work as a UI Designer within the realm of Adtech.
                GreedyGame is a Google Channel Partner, which provided me a stimulating environment to innovate and
                collaborate across different teams.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>We identified a significant gap between our brand identity and the individual products offered on our
                website. Despite each product having its own standalone presence, there was an inconsistency in how our
                brand was represented across these offerings, hindering our ability to convey our message.
                Our existing website lacked refinements in various areas- design trends, and educating the users. We
                also sought to implement the best practices followed by the industry giants. Our previous website failed
                to provide a better user experience due to its unstructured approach.</p>

            <h2>My Role as a Designer</h2>
            <p>As a designer, my role is to going into the depth of the research on the existing product, what is the
                end goal to reach and to execute it. Some of the guidelines that I set for myself before starting this
                project are:

                    <li>Analyse competitors' websites to identify both <br> ineffective elements and successful

                        refine our website design.</li>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                To address the challenges, we conceptualised and developed a new platform that seamlessly integrated all
                our products and services, providing advertisers and publishers with a comprehensive solution. Through
                collaborative efforts and cross-functional teamwork, we successfully launched this unified platform,
                marking a significant milestone for GreedyGame. This initiative not only strengthened our brand identity
                but also enhanced user satisfaction and engagement.

                We discovered other innovative opportunities to monetise apps/ games leading us to come up with two
                novel products- Immersive Ads and Offerwall Ads. This called for the creation of two new product pages
                and the restructuring of our homepage. This called for the creation of two new product pages and the

            <p>
                We have established a distinction between the company's brand and the product successfully.
                In doing so, we have educated them about our dashboard. Additionally, we have enhanced the user
                experience by creating a seamless flow enabling users to navigate the website with ease.
