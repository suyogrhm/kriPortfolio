            <h1>IMDb Case Study</h1>
            <p>The website works like a CV or resume of the cast & production crew. It has about 3 million data base
                about movies, & TV series with over 200 million new viewers every month. IMDb has two types of revenue.

            <p>IMDb's main competitors are Netflix, Youtube, Rottentomato and Hulu. These websites all have a common
                purpose of sharing information or experiences in various forms. This information can be contributed by
                the staff or the fans.
                IMDb is known for its website's data, which is not accessible to everyone. The data may have the
                contributions of certain fans, but it is uploaded only after vigorous authentications by the AI system
                and staff of IMDb. Hence, the database produced by IMDb is both vast and accurate, whereas the
                information contributed by its competitors is not so.</p>

            <p> The common problem that we all face is finding a movie to watch on the right OTT platform, both of which
                can be solved by IMDb.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">What if we can make things even better?</p>
            <p>Even though IMDb is owned by Amazon, it functions as a neutral party to Netflix, Hotstar and Prime
                Video. What if IMDb can come up with a subscription plan where you can access any movie from any OTT
                platform with just one bill to be paid to IMDb?

            <h2>Design Basic Index - Jim Krause</h2>
            <p>
                If a web surfer loads a page that appears before a user as a disorderly and daunting wall of content,
                they are likely to perceive the site as being of suspect integrity and its product of dubious quality,
                or they will simply leave the site.
                An orderly representation of visual dominance between elements not only helps attract attention to a
                section but, also serves to guide the viewer's eye through its content. Elements can dominate through
                relative size, comparison of colour or an intriguing presentation. As a designer, it's up to you to act
                as a referee between competing elements and decide which ones will dominate and how. Avoid a
                fainthearted approach while making these decisions.

                by them. We also need to ensure that the website meets the standards of the competitors, and the
                transition flow from one website to another need to be very subtle. To achieve this, we need to follow a
                certain guideline.
