            <h1>HAMSAK</h1>
            <p>We live in an advanced world where a person needs to commute a lot for their livelihood. We are used to
                travelling with the help of an IC engine which is harmful to the environment. Off late, there is a
                transition where users opt for a vehicle with an electric motor rather than one with an IC engine. This
                created curiosity among us designers to come up with a new electric vehicle design to attract younger
                users, leading to the creation of a cleaner environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing electric vehicles tend to embody either a rugged or cute aesthetic, but rarely manage to
                seamlessly combine both. Typically, users are drawn to a product based on their initial visual
                impressions.

            <h2>User Study Research</h2>
            <p>There are so many vehicles that exist in the market that have been able to attract the users over the
                years. The agenda was to understand the needs of our end users. In this journey, we understood that
                there are many factors that influence the users decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have conducted two surveys- an ethnography study and questionnaire survey. The objective was to
                understand the users and come up with a product that solves their pain-points.

            <h2>Research Findings</h2>
            <p>
                There were many research methods to understand the userâ€™s requirements. We used both quantitative and
                qualitative analysis to understand what the users are looking for. We circulated certain questionnaires
                among the possible users via Google Forms. Additionally, we conducted interviews with existing EV owners
                to understand what are the problems with existing vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, we understood that there is an opportunity for us to create a moped with a cute and rugged
                aesthetic at the same time in the Electric Vehicle segment. The main purpose is to attract the
                youngsters and inspire them to move towards electric with an aesthetic and ergonomically designed EV.
