            <h1>Universal OTT</h1>
            <p>OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms were created out of the intention for users to consume content in various
                devices at any given point of time. These platforms have gained popularity over the past couple of years
                as they provide flexibility in watching any specific content on any device at any time.

            <p>With the increase in popularity of OTT platforms there have been many numerous platforms that have been
                created. These platforms were supposed to be a replacement for our traditional Television and are
                supposed make consuming content more easier. During my research the pain points that I have come a cross

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                The Tata Play Binge bundle currently lacks the inclusion of key platforms such as Netflix and Amazon
                Prime. This omission is a significant drawback, as these platforms host popular shows and movies
                essential for attracting a diverse target audience. To optimize the bundle's appeal and compete
                effectively, it is recommended to consider incorporating Netflix and Amazon Prime into the subscription
                plans. Additionally, the bundle faces a challenge in terms of awareness, given its limited visibility on
                popular search and review platforms such as Google, YouTube, and IMDb. Improving visibility on these
                widely-used platforms is crucial for attracting and informing potential subscribers and enhancing the
                overall success of the Tata Play Binge bundle.

            <h2>Future steps</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, the development of the SDK Kit for Google for the universal OTT platform will focus on
                integrating user feedback to enhance user experience and satisfaction. I plan to implement continuous
                integration and deployment practices for streamlined updates. Exploring AI and machine learning
                integration aims to improve content recommendations and analytics. Expanding platform compatibility,
                including strategic partnerships, will ensure broader reach and accessibility. Additionally, I will
                explore advanced monetisation features, address evolving cybersecurity measures, and adapt to global
                audience needs through localisation. Ongoing education programs for developers, staying abreast of
                industry trends, providing advanced data analytics, and ensuring regulatory compliance will be integral
                to the continued success and relevance of our SDK Kit.
